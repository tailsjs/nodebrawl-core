# nodebrawl-core
The world's first open source Brawl Stars private server core written on JavaScript. <br>
*[Now uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">Classes</a> instead of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions">Functions!</a>]*

* [Русский язык](/README-ru.md)
* Try [nightly](https://github.com/tailsjs/nodebrawl-core/tree/nightly) version of core!

## Requirements
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Brain

## Setting up
1. Download/clone a repository
2. Type in console `npm install`
3. `node index`

* Now you can connect to your server through any Brawl Stars client with Frida Injection.

## Why game isn't loading?
Because it's core. You need implement all messages/packets and logic by yourself.
